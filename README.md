For this AoC, I'm trying to stick to base R functions only, which after day 3 has proven more complicated than I thought ([`purrr`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org) me-ow out! 🐈). That being said,
I'm hoping to eventually refactor my solutions, so they can be a bit less clunky, but still using
base R (and trying to stay away from the pipe, `|>`, so the code runs with older versions of R 🤔). - R-berto
